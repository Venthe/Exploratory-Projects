# Versioning

## Version 3

Designed to be cross-compatible between Compose and the Docker Engineâ€™s [swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/), version 3 removes several options and adds several more.

* Removed: `volume_driver`, `volumes_from`, `cpu_shares`, `cpu_quota`, `cpuset`, `mem_limit`, `memswap_limit`, `extends`, `group_add`. See the [upgrading](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#upgrading) guide for how to migrate away from these. (For more information on `extends`, see [Extending services](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#extending-services).)

* Added: [deploy](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#deploy)


> **Note**: When specifying the Compose file version to use, make sure to specify both the _major_ and _minor_ numbers. If no minor version is given, `0` is used by default and not the latest minor version. As a result, features added in later versions will not be supported. For example:
>
> ```
> version: "3"
> ```
>
> is equivalent to:
>
> ```
> version: "3.0"
> ```
